# Youtube Title and Script generator
Followed a simple langchain tutorial from Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlK6SIjcjE8), learning which dependencies to import and using prompt templates and chains. The end result is an app that asks for a prompt to generate a Youtube title and a script based on that title.

The app is created with streamlit but is not published publicly. Please install streamlit  ```pip install streamlit``` and navigate to the file and run it by using  ```streamlit run langchain_llm.py```
